# Personal Website

I'm Ethan Thomas, and this is the source code for my personal website, which is live at [ethanmt.com](https://www.ethanmt.com/).

This is a Next.js project using Typescript and React. The site features an interactive version of my resume, as well as some personal information. The site is hosted using Netlify.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ethmth/personal-website.git

Run a development version of the site.

```
